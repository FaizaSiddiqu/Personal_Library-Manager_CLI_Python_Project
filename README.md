 # Personal Library Manager ðŸ“š
A Command Line Interface (CLI) based Python project to manage your personal library. This tool allows you to add, remove, search, and display books in your library, along with displaying statistics like the total number of books and the percentage of books you've read.

## Features ðŸŒŸ
**Add a Book:** Add a new book to your library by providing details like title, author, year, genre, and read status.

**Remove a Book:** Remove a book from your library by entering its title.

**Search the Library:** Search for books by title or author.

**Display All Books:** View all the books in your library along with their details.
